Make sure you have a plenary comment for every lesson.\r\nOne minor mistake on the HCF/LCM problems - you must use the prime factors. \r\nMake sure you give the units in any problem involving measurements.

Your homework got a bit untidy so it was hard to work out what went with what. On a calculator paper, you can use the FACT button. That will help you make sure you have all the factors.\r\nAsk for the 3D solids so you can have a look at how to draw the plans and elevations for a cone and square-based pyramid.	Have a go at the plans/elevations you missed. Then have a go at the missing HCF/LCM.	N/A	2018-09-12 17:55:44.553197	2018-09-12 20:53:03.585385	6	f	f	\N	f

If you struggle in lessons you MUST come and see me at break/lunch and I will go through it with you. 	If you are stuck on a homework you MUST ask for help.

Your work on experimental probability was good, although you did not attempt the second question. Your work on multiplying by 10 and 100 was also excellent.

Thank you for resubmitting HW 11. It was very well done indeed. 	This was a very good homework. You did excellently on the first part of the homework, even more so considering we have not covered it.

There is nothing wrong in using tools as long as you understand how to tackle the problems (you won't have Desmos in your exam ...)	A good homework. Have a look again at acceleration (the gradient of the velocity-time graph). Your graph work was excellent. I know you used Desmos to get the answers - do you know how to use a graph to read off values?

1698	224	\N	Well done for re-submitting the overdue homeworks. According to my records you still owe HW 27.  I am concerned by the amount of work I see in your book. You were moved to the front because your work was not of the standard required. I expect to see an improvement.\r\n	In Q1 you gave the value of the 10th term. You were asked for the first 5 terms. So the first term n=1. The second term, n=2. The third term n = 3, and so on. You completed a worksheet on this earlier.  On Q2 you had the right digits, but your multiplication was wrong. Use your calculator to check your answers. Finally on the last question, 0.9 x 0.3. 9 x 3 = 27. How many decimal points are there? Two, so there must be two in the answer, so it must be 0.27.

I am disappointed that this far into the year you are still not completing the homework feedback form properly. 	There is no way that there is anything like enough space on the worksheet to do the workings out. Why did you try and squeeze it on there? It makes it very difficult to follow your workings and you are not showing enough detail. Unfortunately you seem to have confused SA and volume. I am afraid this homework needs to be resubmitted.

If you wish to remain in this set you will do the work. If you don't there are plenty of other students to take your place. 	The main problem with this homework was a near total lack of working out.

You were 100% correct in working out the bracket, but you seemed a bit confused about what to add or subtract. Look at the integer term (x + 2) - so the "2". When I square that bracket that 2 is going to be squared to give me 4. Work out what you have to add or subtract to 4 to give you the number the question is asking for. So if it is +8, then your answer would be (x+2)^2 + 4. If it were -8, then it would be  x+2)^2 - 12.
